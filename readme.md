# War Card Game in Go

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic card game "War" written in Go. The game is played in the command line and simulates a two-player game where each player draws a card from their deck, and the player with the higher card wins the round.

## Installation

To play the War card game, you need to have Go installed on your computer. If you don't have Go installed, you can download it from the official Go website.

Once Go is installed, you can clone the repository and build the game and run it
